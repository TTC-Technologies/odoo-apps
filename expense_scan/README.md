# Expense Receipt Scanner — Odoo 19

Photograph a receipt with your phone and get a filled-in expense, reviewed
side by side with the image of the receipt.

Everything runs **on your own server**: no IAP account, no API key, no paid
token, no document sent to a third party.

---

## What the module does

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| **One tap** | The **Scan** (mobile) / **Upload** (desktop) button of the expense list opens the camera or the photo library directly. |
| **Crop** | The edges of the receipt are detected in the photo, the perspective is corrected, the image is cut out. |
| **Straighten** | The remaining tilt of the lines is measured and cancelled; a photo taken sideways (quarter turn) is turned upright. |
| **Read** | AI reads the receipt: the PP-OCR neural networks (text area detection + recognition), on your own server, in about 0.5 to 1.5 s on a recent processor. |
| **Extract** | Merchant, date, time, total, currency and tax are extracted, each with a confidence score. |
| **Review** | The form opens at once, receipt on one side, fields on the other: the scan runs in the background, shows its progress and fills the fields as it goes. A hint appears under each field to check (date, total, tax, category...) and goes away once it is corrected. |

The module **never approves** an expense on its own: it fills in, flags what
is doubtful, and leaves the decision to the user.

### What it adds to Odoo 19

Odoo 19 Community already provides the receipt upload button and the receipt
preview panel. The module builds on them rather than rewriting them, and adds
what is missing:

- the OCR reading itself (Enterprise only, through IAP);
- cropping and straightening of the photo;
- opening the review form directly after a single scan (Odoo otherwise goes
  back to a list);
- the receipt preview on phones and on screens narrower than 1400 px, where
  Odoo shows no panel;
- a camera / gallery / files choice on phones, so that the camera comes
  first on iOS and Android.

### And around the scan

- **Category**: recognised from the receipt words declared on each category,
  the activity code printed on the receipt, the price per litre or kWh, a
  known brand at the top, and the history of merchants already classified.
  The module creates no category of its own: yours get suggested words when
  their name evokes a family (fuel, tolls, meals...), and every day it
  learns the words found on the receipts your team filed in each category
  (a "Subscriptions" category ends up recognised without anyone typing a
  word). Only categories chosen by a person teach, a correction counts for
  more than a confirmation, and a word entered by hand is never overridden.
- **Several receipts for one purchase** (till receipt + card slip): the
  pieces are compared and merged into one expense, or split when they
  clearly describe two purchases.
- **Retouch**: rotate and crop a receipt by hand, or accept the automatic
  suggestion.
- **Trip purpose**: an expense on the same day or at the same place as a
  neighbouring expense takes up its description ("Sales visit Acme").
- **Projects**: re-invoice an expense to a project, or charge it to the
  project budget only; the analytic account follows the project. The approved
  expenses of a project add up on one line of its sales order, and an
  expense budget can be followed on the project.
- **Expense sheets**: PDF summary with tax by rate and numbered receipts,
  Excel export on your own template.
- **Expense rules**: meal, daily and hotel ceilings, words to watch; a
  warning shows on the expense and a filter gathers them.
- **VAT correction**: once an expense is posted, an accounting manager can
  declare its VAT not recoverable, recoverable or another amount (*Correct
  VAT*, on the expense or on a selection); a miscellaneous entry moves only the
  difference, through the tax engine and on the analytic distribution of the
  expense, and the reimbursement and the re-invoicing do not change.
- **Team**: managers enter expenses for their team members.
- **E-mail**: receipts sent from an employee's private address are
  recognised; the subject becomes the description.
- **Mileage**: a mileage rate per employee.
- **Foreign receipts**: the currency printed on the receipt is recorded (and
  activated in Odoo if needed); a tax paid abroad (German MwSt for a French
  company, Italian IVA for a German one...) is not carried as deductible VAT.
- **Exchange rates**: the reference rates of the European Central Bank are
  added every day for the active currencies, so that a foreign receipt is
  converted at the rate of its own day — Odoo Community updates no rate on
  its own.
- **Languages**: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch,
  Portuguese, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish.

## Server requirements

To install in Odoo's Python environment, with `pip` for the Python packages
and the system package manager for Tesseract and Poppler:

| Package | Role | Declared |
|---|---|---|
| `opencv-python-headless` | cropping, straightening | yes |
| `numpy` | same | yes (pulled by OpenCV) |
| `rapidocr` + `onnxruntime` | OCR engine | yes |
| `pdf2image` + `poppler-utils` (`pdftoppm`) | PDF receipts | yes |
| `openpyxl` | Excel export of expense sheets | yes |
| `Pillow`, `requests`, `reportlab` | images, exchange rates, PDF sheets | already in Odoo |
| `pytesseract` + a `tesseract-ocr-<lang>` package | fallback engine | no, optional |

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless rapidocr onnxruntime pdf2image openpyxl
sudo apt install poppler-utils
```

The declared dependencies are checked by Odoo when the module is installed:
a missing one stops the installation with its name, rather than leaving a
module that installs but cannot read a receipt. The settings screen also
shows the state of each engine.

**Footprint**: the PP-OCR models weigh a few tens of megabytes and are
downloaded once, at the first scan or with the *Test and preload the engine*
button. They are stored in Odoo's data directory, not in `site-packages`.

**Worker memory**: with workers (`workers > 0`), Odoo recycles a worker that
exceeds `limit_memory_soft`, measured as *virtual* memory. The glibc
allocator reserves up to 64 MB of address space per allocating thread, and
the OCR engine adds about twenty: the virtual memory of a worker jumps by two
gigabytes at the first scan, while the memory actually used does not follow.
The worker is then recycled after each scan, and the next one loads the
models again — one more second. Limiting these reservations in the service
environment solves it:

```ini
# systemctl edit odoo19
[Service]
Environment=MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2
```

## Settings

**Expenses → Configuration → Settings → Expenses**. Everyday settings come
first, each with a sentence of explanation; the ones nobody needs to touch
are gathered under *Receipt scanner: advanced options*.

- **Receipt scanning**: on by default.
- **Re-invoicing**: *Re-invoice expenses to a project*, off by default (not
  every organisation works by project), and *Limit the projects to the
  employee's own* once it is on (on by default; a project manager or an
  administrator always sees every project).
- **Fields filled in by the scan**: *Use the tax read on the receipt* is on
  by default: the tax printed on the receipt goes to the journal entry, and
  the tax of its rate is set on the expense. *Look up the vendor* is off by
  default. *Exchange rates from the European Central Bank* is on by default:
  a daily task adds the reference rates of the last ninety days for the
  active currencies, and the rate of its day for an older receipt. Apart from
  the one-time download of the OCR models, it is the only network request of
  the module: a public file, never during a scan, and nothing leaves the server. The default category is the one given to a
  receipt that names none.
- **Expense rules and sheets**: links to the rules and to the Excel
  templates.

Under *Receipt scanner: advanced options*:

- **Reading engine**: `Automatic` uses RapidOCR (the PP-OCR neural networks,
  the more accurate of the two) if available, otherwise AI Tesseract, its
  neural-network fallback. *Threads per worker* is 4 by default: Odoo already runs several
  workers; letting ONNX open one thread per core in each of them lowers the
  throughput instead of raising it.
- **Photo processing**: crop, straighten, turn sideways receipts upright, keep
  the original photo, and *Receipt beside the form on narrower screens*
  (from 768 px wide, which Odoo otherwise leaves without a preview).
- **Dates and kept text**: the age beyond which a date is ignored, and how
  long the text read on a receipt is kept.
- **Odoo's menus and filters**: three options, off by default, for every
  company: rename the "My Expenses" menu group "Expense follow-up", open the
  expense lists on the current month, and remove the "My Team", "Company" and
  "Employee" shortcuts from the filters. Uninstalling the module gives Odoo
  back its menu name, icon and filters.

The **Test and preload the engine** button loads the models and reads a
control image: use it after each restart of the service, so that the first
real scan does not pay for the loading.

## Getting started in five minutes

1. **Expenses → Configuration → Settings**: scanning is on by default;
   *Test and preload the engine* checks the installation.
2. **Scan a receipt** from the expense list (*Scan* button on a phone,
   *Upload* on a computer).
3. **Expense rules**: the delivered "Good practice" set already watches
   fines, hotel extras, alcohol and travel class on every expense. Add your
   own ceilings, duplicate it for a customer, or switch it off with its
   switch in the list (*Configuration → Expense Rules*).
4. **Expense sheet**: select expenses, then the *Expense Sheet* button. The
   delivered Excel template, "Expense sheet (basic template)", can be
   downloaded, adapted and uploaded again (*Configuration → Excel Export
   Templates*).
5. **Projects** (optional): tick *Re-invoice expenses to a project* in the
   settings.

A database created with demo data also holds a made-up customer, its project
and its own requirements.

## Projects, expense sheets and expense rules

- **Re-invoicing**: the *Re-invoice* column of the expense lists shows
  whether an expense is re-invoiced (a ticked box), not (an empty box) or
  still to decide (a question mark); a click switches it. An expense without a
  project is not re-invoiced and has nothing to decide; choosing a project sets
  "Yes", and "No" keeps the cost on the project without billing it. The manager
  cannot approve an expense left "to decide". Once approved, the
  expense is added up with the others of its project on the **expense line**
  of the project's sales order (the line whose product can be expensed): its
  quantity is the amount incl. tax, at a unit price of 1, so one invoice line
  carries the month's expenses. The line only moves when no expense of the
  project is left waiting for the manager or for a decision (an activity
  on the order says so). When the invoice is posted, the expenses it covers
  are posted too, unless they were posted by hand before, to repay the
  employee without waiting. Without Sales, nothing changes.
- **Expense budget**: the **Expenses** tab of the project form holds a
  planned amount, the approved expenses, those still to approve and the budget
  left (and tells where to turn re-invoicing on when it is off).
- **Project and task**: "Re-invoice: Yes" puts the expense on the project's
  sales order line (see above); "No" can keep the project, for tracking only. The expense is
  charged to the project's analytic account (created if needed): it shows
  under the project's **Expenses** button, and in its profitability once
  posted. The **Task** field only shows if the project has open tasks; the
  first one, in the project's order, is suggested.
- **Expense sheet** (button in place of "Print" on the list): PDF summary
  with tax by rate and numbered receipts, Excel export on a template
  (*Configuration → Excel Export Templates*), one sheet per employee, gathered in
  an archive when there are several.
- **Expense rules** (*Configuration → Expense Rules*): ceilings per meal, per
  day or per night, words to watch. The warning shows at the top of the
  expense, with a sign in the list (⚠ breach, ℹ︎ point to check) that "Save and close"
  or a justification puts out; breaches can be filtered ("Rule breaches"). A
  set of rules applies to all expenses, to the projects of some customers,
  or to chosen projects.
- **Team and batches**: *My Team's Expenses* to enter expenses in a team
  member's name, and *Actions → Back to draft* on a selection. An accountant
  reimburses with the *Reimburse the employee* button of a posted expense, or
  of a selection in the list.

## Country specifics

Nothing in the module is tied to one country; a few things are there for the
receipts of some countries. It was tried on databases set up in France,
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Poland and Sweden, with real
receipts of these countries and of their neighbours:

- **Domestic and foreign VAT**: the name printed on the receipt is compared
  with those of the company's country (TVA in France, MwSt/USt in Germany
  and Austria, Moms in Sweden and Denmark, MVA in Norway, BTW, IVA, PTU...).
  A foreign tax, a foreign currency or a rate unknown to the chart of
  accounts marks the tax as foreign: it is not deducted.
- **Several taxes at one rate** (goods, services, intra-EU purchases, as in
  the Swedish or German charts of accounts): the tax of the category comes
  first, otherwise the first ordinary tax of the chart.
- **French merchants**: many French receipts print the SIRET number but not
  the activity code. An administrator can load the public Sirene database of
  establishments (`expense.scan.sirene`), which then gives the activity of
  the merchant from its SIRET. Without it, the other clues are used.
- **Categories without recoverable VAT**: where VAT cannot be deducted on
  some expenses (employee accommodation or passenger transport in France,
  for instance), tick *Flat rate without VAT* on the category.
- **Mileage**: each employee can have their own rate per kilometre or mile,
  to follow the official scale of your country.

```

The `ocr/` folder does not know Odoo: keywords and thresholds can be tuned,
and the parser tests run, without a database.

### Adding an engine

Write a subclass of `ScanEngine` (`availability()` and `recognize()`),
register it in `ENGINE_CLASSES`, add its code to the selection on
`res.company`. Nothing else to change: the preprocessing and the parser work
on the same list of positioned words.

---

## Known limits

- **Recognition model**: the module keeps the first set of models that reads
  its control receipt back. On `rapidocr` 3.9.2, the `latin` models load but
  recognise nothing; they are therefore skipped in favour of the library's
  default model, which reads accented Latin text without trouble. If a later
  version of the library fixes the latin models, they will be candidates
  again with nothing to change.
- **Item lines**: the module extracts the header and the total, not the item
  details. An Odoo expense has a single amount anyway.
- **Several tax rates** on the same receipt: the module keeps the exact sum
  of the taxes read and sets the highest rate on the expense; the accountant
  can correct it.
- **First scan after a restart**: each Odoo worker loads the models on its
  own, which adds one to three seconds. The warm-up button only covers the
  worker that handled the request.
- **PDF**: the first page is always read; if it gives no total, the next
  pages are read too (up to 5), to find it at the foot of a multi-page
  invoice. The image shown stays the first page.
- **Limits**: a receipt over 25 MB is refused; an image over 50 megapixels is
  scaled down while decoding (over 250 Mpx, refused); a PDF is rendered at a
  resolution that fits within the same limit, with a 30 s timeout.
- **Interrupted scan**: a scan "running" for more than 15 minutes — a receipt
  that got its worker killed — is no longer picked up; the expense goes to
  error and is entered by hand.

---

## Personal data

The text read on a receipt (names, addresses, last digits of a card...) is
kept on the expense for the scan and for linking neighbouring trips. A daily
task erases it from submitted expenses older than **Keep the text read for**
(10 years by default, the retention period of accounting records in France —
Commercial Code, art. L123-22; 0 = never). The image of the receipt stays:
it is the accounting record.

---

## Development

`tools/check.py` compiles the whole module in a second (run it before an
update). `tools/bench.py` replays the parsing on a snapshot of texts already
read, without Odoo, and compares file by file with a reference measure: this
is what allows changing the parser without regressions. Its instructions are
at the top of the file. The receipts, the snapshot and the truth tables are
personal data: they are never versioned.

---

## Tests

```bash
odoo -d <database> -i expense_scan --test-enable --test-tags /expense_scan --stop-after-init
```

The preprocessing tests skip themselves if OpenCV is not installed.

## Licence

LGPL-3, like Odoo Community.
