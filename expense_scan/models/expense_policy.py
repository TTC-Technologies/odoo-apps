"""Expense rules: company good practice and customer requirements.

A rule set applies to every expense (meal and hotel limits, personal
expenses to exclude) or to the projects of some customers, who often impose
their own: travel class, their own limits.

The check warns without blocking: going over may be justified and the
reading of a receipt may be wrong. Two levels, the breach ("over") and the
doubt ("to check"), shown at the top of the expense and filterable in the
list.
