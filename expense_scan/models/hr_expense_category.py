"""Expense category, recognised from the merchant or the words of the receipt.

The clues, from the most to the least reliable:

1. **The shared merchant history.** A submitted expense carries its
   merchant and category, confirmed by the employee. The next expense from
   the same merchant gets the same category, whoever the employee. The
   merchant as the OCR read it is kept apart: a logo is misread, but always
   the same way, so "Rchan" points to Auchan once someone has corrected it.
   This is the heaviest clue, without being final: a receipt that clearly
   points to another category wins.
2. Additional clues:

   * the **activity code** printed on the receipt (APE, MCC) or found in the
     Sirene database from the SIRET number;
   * the **words of the receipt**, declared on each category, in every
     language met while travelling;
   * a **known brand** at the top of the receipt, from OpenStreetMap's Name
     Suggestion Index.

Without certainty, no category is chosen: the default category stays and
the field is flagged for review. Flat rates (mileage, scales) are never
suggested: they do not come from a receipt. They are recognised by their
fixed price or their distance unit; a category merely "without VAT", like
the hotel, can still be suggested.
