"""Unit price of fixed-cost categories, mileage in particular.

Odoo computes the price back from the total, which overwrites the rate
entered. On a fixed-cost category, the price is no longer recomputed once
set: it gets an initial value (the employee's rate for a distance, the
category cost otherwise), then what the user enters prevails and the total
follows from it.

Starting from the total would round the price to the cent: 0.636 per km
would become 0.64.
