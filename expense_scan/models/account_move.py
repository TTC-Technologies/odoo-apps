"""Customer invoices that carry re-invoiced expenses.

A draft invoice made from a sales order reserves the expenses its expense line
covers: from then on they cannot be taken back or changed, since the invoice
bills them. Posting the invoice posts the expenses in turn, unless they were
posted by hand before (to repay the employee without waiting for the
invoice). Deleting, cancelling or resetting the invoice frees them.

The expense lines of the orders are brought up to date first when a batch of
expenses is in progress (``hr.expense._expense_scan_batch_sync``), as they would
be outside one.
