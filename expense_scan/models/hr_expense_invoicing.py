"""Re-invoicing the expenses of a project on one line of its sales order.

Odoo's own mechanism (``sale_expense``) adds one order line per expense, once
the expense is posted. Here the approved expenses of a project are added up on
the order's expense line (the line whose product can be expensed): its
quantity is the amount incl. tax, at a unit price of 1. The next invoice takes
what has not been invoiced yet and posts the expenses it covers.

The line is updated at each change of an expense, or once at the end of a
batch (``_expense_scan_batch_sync``) for loops over many expenses.

Everything is optional. Without Sales, without a project or with the company
setting off, nothing happens.
