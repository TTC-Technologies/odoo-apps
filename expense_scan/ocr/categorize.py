"""Category clues given by a receipt, without depending on Odoo.

The model adds the merchant history, which lives in the database, to these
clues. Everything else (receipt words, activity code, unit price, brand) is
computed here, so that the benchmark (``tools/bench.py``) replays exactly
the module's behaviour.

Categories are designated by any key: the product id in Odoo, its code in
the benchmark.
