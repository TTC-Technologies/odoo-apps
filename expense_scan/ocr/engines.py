"""Interchangeable text recognition engines.

Two implementations are provided, both local, free and without any token:

* ``rapidocr``: the PP-OCR networks run by ONNX Runtime. Clearly better than
  Tesseract on a thermal receipt (faded print, crumpled paper, condensed
  font), for a CPU cost of about a second.
* ``tesseract``: fallback engine, without a neural detection network.

To add an engine, write a subclass of :class:`ScanEngine` and register it in
``ENGINE_CLASSES``.
